# 📚 Data Structure and Algorithms

Welcome to the **Data Structure and Algorithms** repository! 🚀 This repository contains well-structured and efficient implementations of various **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** in **C++**, with clear explanations and organized code.

## 📌 Repository Structure

The repository is structured into two main sections:

1. **Data Structures** 📂  
   - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hashing Structures, and more.
   
2. **Algorithms** ⚙️  
   - Sorting, Searching, Recursion & Backtracking, Divide & Conquer, Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Graph Algorithms, Tree Algorithms, Bit Manipulation, Mathematics, String Algorithms, and Computational Geometry.
